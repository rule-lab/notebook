Tecan Fluorescence Determination of TLC's Kd for DIR
----------------------------------------------------

Planned Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A black, opaque-bottomed, 96-well plate will be used to assay the dissociation
kinetics of TLC and DIR. A sequence of 12 distinct concentrations of DIR will
be mixed with a constant concentration of TLC, constituting a DIR titration.
These mixtures will be measured in triplicate on the Tecan Safire in the MBIC
common room. Previous experiments showed observable fluoresecence with 100nM
TLC so that concentration will be used once more. My desired upper range of DIR
concentration is 1mM; my desired lower range is 1mM.

Calculations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To achieve 100nM of TLC in a well volume of 200uL from the
:ref:`concentration of Elution Fraction 2 <9-24-12-expression>`

.. math::

   6.34uM \times \chi uL = 6340nM \times \chi uL = 100nM * 200uL

   \chi = 20000 / 6340 uL = 3.15uL
