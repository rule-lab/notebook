Yeast Transformation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transformation of YVH10 with PNL6_TLC was delayed due to insufficient overnight
growth. Will be performed tomorrow.

Tecan Assay for Alternative Fluorogen Activation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal of this experiment was to determine whether TLC activates any of the
fluorogens, T01-2P, aCN-TO-AME, OTB-AME, MG-Ester, aCN-DIR, and DIR-AME (a
positive control, as demonstrated especially in :doc:`26` as the K :sub:`d` was
determined by DIR fluorescence. The same concentration of TLC, ~100nM, was used
in all samples, and each dye was examined at concentrations of 1uM and 10um.
All samples were performed in quadruplicate, except for DIR-AME which was
done in triplicate. A protein-only control took the place of the fourth well.
Dye-only controls were employed for each sample, replacing the TLC ingredient
with the same volume of ddH2O

These samples were assayed using the Tecan Safire2 in MBIC. Previously
reported wavelengths were available for all but aCN-TO-AME. I did perform 2D
scans on OTB-AME and aCN-DIR, and a 3D scan on MG-Ester in the interest of
refining the sensitivity of the assay. Since I didn't know the expected
wavelengths for aCN-TO-AME, I performed 3D scans to do my best to
independently determine them. I will compare these values to others' when I can
find someone who has worked with this dye.

I will post processed data in a future entry and post a link here to that data
and a summary.
