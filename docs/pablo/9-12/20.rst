Protein Prep of TLC
-------------------

Induced C3013 cells containing pET22b(+)-TLC were spun down in two separate
containers yesterday. These were removed from the -80C freezer and placed on
ice for ~20 minutes. 5mL of Eq/Wash Buffer was added to each vessel and allowed
to sit for 20 minutes with occasional swirling. This cell resuspension was then
placed in a small plastic beaker with a small magnetic stirbar and placed in an
ice bath. Another 5mL of buffer was used to wash out the containers and was
then poured into the beaker.

A pinch of lysozyme was added to the cell
resuspension and the mixture was set to stir for ~45 minutes. After removing
the stirbar, the cells were tranferred to the sonicator in the cold room and
program 5 was executed. The lysate was then tranferred to centrifuge tubes for
the ultracentrifuge in the Ho Lab.

There were errors with the ultracentrifuge that I ultimately was not able to
address today. After much wasted time and work troubleshooting, I was unable
to properly use the ultracentrifuge. It probably needs professional
maintenance as it was unable to go past 5.7K rpm and would issue a "Drive"
error and stop. I did the following after my class, at Sahil's suggestion.

Around 8:30pm, I portioned the cell lysate into 22 microcentrifuge tubes and
then spun them at maximum microfuge speed for 25 minutes. I used the microfuge
located in the Macbeth Lab cold room. I then collected the lysate supernatant
into two 15mL tubes and stored them on ice in the cold room overnight.

Advanced Algorithms
-------------------

I gave a lecture/discussion on two papers, doi:10.1038/nsb805 and
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17951810 Dr. Ilyin advised that I focus less
on the mathematical proofs, and rather more on the fundamental ideas they
illustrate.
