Tecan Data Processing
---------------------

A plot of the data can be found in this :download:`spreadsheet <6-28-Plotted.xls>`.
Gordon fit the data and found that the K :sub:`d` of TLC and DIR to be in the
range of 5-7uM. He suggested that the spread of points was not ideal, some data
between 800nM and 6000nM would be good.

Testing Other Fluorogens
------------------------

At the present, I have a selection of a half dozen fluorogen dyes, including
DIR. I summarize them and their properties here:

Fluorogens:

**TO1-2p**
   **Extinction Coefficient**
      :math:`58,000M^{-1}cm^{-1}` at 504nm, in aqueous phosphate buffered solution (pH 7)

   **Concentration**
      629uM. I produced a :ref:`phosphate buffered solution 1 <6-28-12-pbs-1>` to
      measure this. An absorbance reading of a 1/500X dilution yielded an
      absorbance of 0.073.

   **Excitation**
      ~509nm

   **Emission**
      ~530nm

**αCN-TO-AME**
   **Concentration**
      10.8mM

**DIR-AME**
   **Extinction Coefficient**
      :math:`134,000M^{-1}cm^{-1}` at 602nm, in methanol

   **Concentration**
      1.04mM

   **Excitation Peak**
      613nm

   **Emission Peak**
      644nm

   **Notes**
      My current stock solution is in DMSO. The wavelengths given were determined
      for TLC using multidimensional scans with the Tecan Safire2. Previous
      references to DIR refer to this DIR-AME.

**αCN-DIR**
   **Concentration**
      *Suspected to be around 500uM-1mM*

   **Excitation**
      522-528nm

   **Emission**
      606nm

   **Notes**
      These wavelengths determined from multidimensional Tecan scans. Their
      accuracy may be subject to some doubt, further study is needed. There is
      a lack of cited information about this dye, preventing me from making
      anything more than a rough estimate of concentration.

**MG-Ester**
   **Concentration**
      680uM

   **Extinction Coefficient**
      :math:`100,000M^{-1}cm^{-1}` at 607nm, in *unspecified, see notes*

   **Excitation**
      629-640nm

   **Emission**
      649-668nm

   **Notes**
      Solvent conditions were not noted on the spec sheet for this dye. I made
      the assumption that it was to be measured in aqueous solution, and used
      a 1/500X dilution into a :ref:`phosphate buffered solution 1 <6-28-12-pbs-1>`.

**OTB-AME**
   **Concentration**
      574uM

   **Extinction Coefficient**
      The cited extinction coefficient for OTB-SO3 is:math:`92,400M^{-1}cm{-1}`
      at 400nm, in :ref:`phosphate buffered solution 2 <6-28-12-pbs-2-otb>`

   **Excitation**
      400nm

   **Emission**
      420nm (Can shift up to 430-440nm for some FAPs)

   **Notes**
      It is unclear to what extent the AME alters this fluorogen, I have not
      yet found relevant citeable information.
