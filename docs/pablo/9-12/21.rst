====================

Protein Prep of TLC
-------------------

Equilibrated 2mL (1mL of resin) of HisPur Cobalt Resin with
:ref:`Eq/Wash Buffer <hispur-native-eqw-buffer>`.

Batch Binding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The equilibrated cobalt resin was combined with the cellular lysate supernatant
from yesterday and placed on a tilt-shaker in the cold room. This was allowed
to mix for about 2.5 hours, then was placed on a column.

Collecting of Column Fractions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The resin volume is approximately 1mL (2mL of resin suspended in stock solution).

The initial column flow through was collected: FT

The column was washed four times with 1mL volumes of :ref:`Eq/Wash Buffer
<hispur-native-eqw-buffer>`. These were
collected as W1-W4.

The column was washed five times with 1mL volumes of :ref:`Elution Buffer
<hispur-native-elute-buffer>`. These were collected as E1-E5.

Stored in an ice bath in the cold room overnight.

Gel Analysis of Fractions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Postponed until tomorrow, this section will be replaced by a reference to that
data.


Made fresh Eq/W Buffer:
-----------------------

500mL of :ref:`Equilibration/Wash Buffer <hispur-native-eqw-buffer>` was made.
This is for native conditions.



Started YVH10 Culture
---------------------
2 20mL cultures were started from single colonies of yeast strain YVH10 (MBIC
strain BJ10760). One will be used for a transformation with PNL6-TLC, the other
a Rule Lab glycerol stock for long-term storage. 20mL of media added to a 125mL
Erlenmeyer flask (not added to a culture tube, does not achieve sufficient
mixing for yeast) and shaken overnight at 30C.
