Gel Analysis of Fractions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A 15% Acrylamide SDS Gel was poured to analyze the column fractions with a 3%
stacking gel. It was observed however, once attempting to separate the plates
containing the gel that the 15% section had not fully polymerized. This
suggests that the acrylamide solution had degraded and that a fresh batch needs
to be mixed.
